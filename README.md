# SplitLife
The official plugin for Wracks Split Life

WARNING:
At times, this plugin can be VERY tricky and unoptimized, so its best to keep a log of everything such as life count, pairs, and time aswell as having an admin who just fixes things.

If you use this plugin, please give credit, this was a bitch to code.

The plugin is WracksSplitlife.sk, and requires the Skript plugin itself which you can find [here](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript)

The commands are as follows:

/Splitlife:StartGUI:
Gives you the GUI to start the series (WARNING: if you don't have exactly 8, 16, or 24 players, choose the number ABOVE the amount of players you do have.)

/Splitlife:BoogeyGUI:
Gives you the GUI for the boogeyman. You can roll, cure, and fail all from here aswell as see who the current boogeymen are (max of 3)

/Splitlife:EditLives:
Edits the life count of anyone who isn't playing limited life

/Splitlife:TimerEdit:
Edits a limited life player's timer in MINUTES (/Splitlife:timeredit [player] +-[1-60])

/Splitlife:TimerPause:
Pauses the limited life timer

/Splitlife:LimitedReset:
Resets a limited life player's timer

/Splitlife:Pair:
Pairs two double life players (If there is an unpaired person in the lists, this breaks)

/Splitlife:Unpair:
Unpairs a double life player (This doesn't also remove someones partner, you have to run the command on them too or it breaks.)

/Splitlife:Doublepair:
Was supposed to be Doublepair(s), but this shows you everyone in the double life pairs (Gives you two strings of players, the first player of the top list is paired with the first player of the bottom list, and so on.)

/Splitlife:EditGame:
Edits a players series (1 is third, 2 is last, 3 is double, 4 is limited)

/givelife:
what do you think it is?
