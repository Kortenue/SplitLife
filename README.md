# SplitLife
The official plugin for Wracks Split Life

WARNING:
At times, this plugin can be VERY tricky and unoptimized, so its best to keep a log of everything such as life count, pairs, and time aswell as having an admin who just fixes things.

If you use this plugin, please give credit, this was a bitch to code.

The plugin is WracksSplitlife.sk, and requires the Skript plugin itself which you can find [https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript](here)
